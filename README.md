# Torre_Talent_Insight_Dashboard-Product-Engineer-Intern-
A full-stack project built using Python in Google Colab to explore and analyze professional profiles and job opportunities from the Torre platform. This dashboard helps visualize user strengths, search jobs, and recommend personalized opportunities based on skill matching.

Features:
- People Search; Search Torre profiles by name.
- Genome Visualization; Visualize insights, strengths, and interests from a Torre user.
- Job Search; Filter jobs by keyword and location (Remote, On-site, Hybrid).
- Skill-Based Job Recommendations; Recommend jobs based on user’s Torre genome.
- Bar chart of Skills; Show relationship between skill weight and proficiency.
- Export Results; Save job matches to a downloadable CSV file.

Tech Stack
- Python + Google Colab
- Pandas for data handling
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for plotting
- ipywidgets for interactive UI
- Torre APIs for profile and genome data

Setup
Just open the notebook in Google Colab, install required packages, and run the cells step by step. No external server or API key setup is required.

Resources Used
- https://torre.ai
- Torre Public APIs (Genome, People Search)
- Sample simulated job data (due to API limitations)

Notes:
Torre’s official and unofficial job search APIs had limitations in Colab (CORS, request body issues), so job data is simulated for demonstration purposes.

ATTENTION!!
Sometimes it shows error when you want to see the preview of my code due to the large size in ipynb. Instead, you can access my Google Colab here:
